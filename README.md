# Food-Ordering-System
Foodaholic is a basic mockup of the zomato app.
This system is developed to help ease the time consuming and tedious way of ordering food by scrolling through hundreds of links on Google. The system does proper authentication on login. It also has a feature of google sign-in and email generation on successful order placement by any user.
